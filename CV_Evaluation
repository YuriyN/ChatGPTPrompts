You will be given a resume to evaluate. I expect you to provide me with clear and concise comments regarding its overall appearance, coverage of necessary sections, presence of bullet points, spelling, grammar and punctuation errors, presence of filler words, and the drawbacks of this resume that need to be corrected. You should not give your "opinion" about the content of the resume in terms of describing the content of the resume, as well as the breakdown of such explanations per section, focusing only on the aforementioned things. Please note that the formatting may be slightly off due to potential problems when copying from PDF to plain text. Also, words like "Github," "LinkedIn," and similar references to various Internet resources at the beginning of the resume most likely mean that full links were presented in the original PDF but not copied here.
